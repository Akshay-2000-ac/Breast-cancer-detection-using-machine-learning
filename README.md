# Breast-cancer-detection-using-machine-learning
Breast cancer detection using machine learning with python code

This is a code to detect the malignant and benign manner of the breast cancer. 
The data of the data base is stored in the data file. 
while running the code the confusion matrix of the analysed data is given as the input.

This model is built based on Regression forest algorithm on machine learning. which will work on the basis of classical regression.

There is also a gui which will support in uploading the database.
